{- | This handle carries a proof that it must be seekable.
Note: Handle and SeekableHandle are not thread safe, should not be
shared across threads, beaware when running parallel/concurrent code.

Not seekable:
  - stdin / stdout
  - pipes / FIFOs

But regular files are always seekable. Parquet fundamentally wants random
access, a non-seekable source will not support effecient access without
buffering the entire file.
-}
newtype SeekableHandle = SeekableHandle {getSeekableHandle :: Handle}

{- | If we truely want to support non-seekable files, we need to also consider the case
to buffer the entire file in memory.

Not thread safe, contains mutable reference (as Handle already is).

If we need concurrent / parallel parsing or something, we need to read into ByteString
first, not sharing the same handle.
